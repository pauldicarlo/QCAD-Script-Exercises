# Purpose
This is a learning exercise to:
- [x] Take [plywood dinghy plans available in public]( https://digital.lib.ecu.edu/24078) and [convert panel dimensions to metric (x,y) coordinates](./conversionArtifacts/1940s%20Hull%20Panel%20Positions%20Converted%20to%20Metric.xlsx)
- [ ] Develop proficiency using [QCAD/CAM](https://qcad.org/en/products/qcad-cam) with scripting API.
- [x] Using panel x,y coordinates, create JavaScript files to create DXF filen [QCAD/CAM](https://qcad.org/en/products/qcad-cam).  It is hoped this will make it easier to make corrections.
- [ ] Create [gCode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) from QCAD DXF files for use with CNC cutter using CAM functionality.
- [ ] Purchase [MaslowCNC](https://www.maslowcnc.com/) , assemble it, and cut dinghy panels using gCode. 
- [ ] Construct dinghy using [stitch-and-glue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stitch_and_glue) construction method.

## NOTES
* I am not a naval architect 
* In no way should these diagrams be used in real life (if you do, you are using at your own risk)
* You are better off buying modern boat plans from a legitimate boat designer
  
## Publicly Available Plans
"*Technical drawings and instructions for a 7' 9" Pram Dinghy Plan 24 designed by C. P. & E. D. Burgess for the Hagerty Company. Includes plans and specifications with a material list and complete instructions for building. Published by Douglas Fir Plywood Association, Tacoma, Washington (June 15, 1940).*"  https://digital.lib.ecu.edu/24078
