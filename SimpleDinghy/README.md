# Purpose
This is a learning exercise to:
* Learn QCAD/CAM, utilize ECMAScript to take measurements and create panels in CAD program.
* Take an old dinghy plan with panel definitions and convert to metric
* Take DXF file created from CAD program and convert to gCode for use with a CNC Cutter
* Cut out panels using gCode and a Maslow CNC cutter
* Construct boat from plans using stictch-and-glue technique and not original method of plans 

## NOTES
* I am not a naval architect 
* In no way should my diagrams be used in real life (if you do, you are using at your own risk)
* You are better off buying modern boat plans from a legitimate boat designer
  
### Publicly Available Plans
